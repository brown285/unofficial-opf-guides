# Warhorn for Players

###### `Authored by Joel Hager & Doug Hahn`

[Warhorn](http://warhorn.net/) is a web service that manages gaming events. It is commonly used in the Paizo Organized play environment, where players can follow events and reserve seats at public games. 

For many events, players are asked to reserve their seats on Warhorn ahead of time. This allows the organizer and GM to know how many people are attending the event, and what levels the player characters are.

## Finding Events & Reserving Seats
Warhorn is a global collection of events; simply having an account doesn't give you access to all of the listed events. You have to register for the events you want to participate in. Note that each event might have its own rules, designed to enhance the experience for that particular community. 

### Finding Events
----
On the main Warhorn page, there are four options to search for an event:

- `Games` will list games happening today that still have room for signups.   
- `Events` lists upcoming conventions.  
- `Organized Play` takes you to a list of organizations running organized play. Clicking an organization will take you to a page with information about the campaign, including the number of upcoming games listed on Warhorn. 
- `Game Systems` lists all the game systems currently being run on Warhorn; this is a good way to find smaller indie games being organized, such as Call of Cthulu.

 By clicking on the search icon in the sidebar you can filter each search by system, virtual tabletop, language, city, and more.

Many players try to find events in their local area or drill down to events that often host games on their VTT of choice. It's all about preference. 

### Registering for the Event
----
If you find a game that you want to play, you can click on it. Once you get to the specific session, the Details section will show whether there are openings for GMs, Players, or both (or if there is a wait list available). The listing will also contain information about the adventure being organized, as well as any pertinent notes the organizer has included.

At that point, you can register for the event. Once you are cleared (sometimes this happens automatically, and other times it can take a few days) you can sign up to either GM or play.

## Plan & Play

After you've found and registered for events you enjoy, you can start using Warhorn for many of your gaming needs. 

### The Dashboard
----
The home page of Warhorn features a dashboard with "News." This section only populates after you have registered for — and been cleared for — an event. This section isn't news; it's a feed of event information and changes. You can customize it to your liking.

#### Getting to the Events You're Registered For

To find the event you registered for, from the Warhorn home page:

1. Click on `Events`
1. Click on `Registered`
1. Click on the event you wish to view. 

You can also use the "Following" filter to access a list of events you're [following](#following-an-event). 

#### Following an Event

Warhorn classifies the events you are registered for as "Following" and "Registered." "Following" an event places it at the forefront of the website's UI, placing it into your news feed, and more. Often, players will register for events but attend them infrequently. Following an event is an excellent way to flag events that you attend regularly. 

To follow an event you're registered for:

1. Navigate to the Warhorn Home Page
1. Click on `Events`
1. Click on `Registered`
1. Hover your mouse over the event name
1. Click `Follow`

#### Customize the news Feed

By default, everything is turned on in the news feed. Some users prefer fewer items. You can toggle the news feed to show the following items:

###### Events You're Following:

- Event created
- Dates changed
- Location changed
- Session listed

###### Sessions you're signed up for

- Message posted
- Session canceled
- Scenario changed
- Waitlist disabled
- Waitlist enabled

Many players turn off everything but the critical information they need for their news feed. 

### Calendars & Agendas
----
Every event has its own calendar and agenda. These are one of the most common ways regular players sign up for games. 

#### Agenda

To navigate to the Agenda:

1. Go to the event's home page 
1. Click on `Schedule` 
1. Click `Upcoming Games` 

Here, you can find a listing of all the upcoming games along with a variety of filters such as "Only games with open seats" or filters by venue or VTT. Click on a game to reserve your seat. 

<figure markdown>

#### Calendar

Some events have the Calendar view enabled. To navigate to the Calendar:

1. Go to the event's home page 
1. Click on `Schedule` 
1. Click on the current month

As with the Agenda view, you can filter in a variety of ways, including VTT, available seats, location, and more. Click on a game to reserve your seat. You can click to right/left arrows along the top of the calendar to move forward by months — a great strategy for planning your gaming well in advance.

### Email Notifications
----
You can customize how Warhorn sends you email notifications. it is a good idea to have some alerts set up at an address you monitor in case events are canceled or change at the last minute, as GMs will often post this information in the Discussion tab.

To set up your notifications:

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
1. Click `Notifications`
1. Select the drop down for `Games you're signed up for`
1. Toggle the notifications to your liking

It's recommended that `Changes` at least is toggled on.

### Game Session Information
----
Warhorn lists events of all kinds; as such, it's important to be aware of all the different pieces of information out there. There are several kinds of information a listing can have. 

<figure markdown>

<figcaption>A Warhorn listing for a game. Flagged are important areas: the game location (online), the game's tags (which VTT it's hosted on), player classes/roles, and important links (Discord info & Sign-in info)</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Time, Date, Location

Pay attention to the top of the listing, where the game's location is posted. Many events run hybrid sessions, meaning some tables may be online and others will be at a physical location. 

=== "An Online Game"

      <figure markdown>

      <figcaption>An in-person game; note the circled area has the store name.</figcaption>
      </figure>

#### Sidebar

The sidebar contains information about the venue (such as address), and will often contain links to the signup sheet, VTT, and VOIP software that will be used by the group. 

There is also a calendar icon above the adventure cover art. You can click on it to link the event to your calendar (Apple, Google, Office, Outlook, and Yahoo).

#### About Tab

The `About` tab contains the game's details such as session length, language, seat availability, and any tags the scenario or event has (for example, `Online`, `Roll20`, and any metaplot tags dictated by the adventure and game system).

Next, the Content section contains information about the system and character levels allowed. Make sure you are signing up for a game where you have a character within the level range. 

Next is the GM and Players section, where you can sign up to GM or play. Note that games without a GM might not happen, especially if it's the day of the event. 

Finally, there is the wait list section (if the organizer has allowed one, that is). Players can sign up to be wait listed, and they will be slotted in if someone drops. 

#### Discussion Tab

In the discussion tab, players and GMs can discuss the event and plan. Discussion tabs can be used to coordinate what characters or levels to bring and anything else the players find appropriate. Discussion posts cannot be formatted; hyperlinks will automatically work. 

#### Activity Tab

Finally, there is the Activity tab, which logs all the activities the event has, such as signups and withdrawals. 

## Best practices

There are some unwritten norms many Warhorn events have; many of these events thrive based on mutual respect for one another's time and efforts. Here are some tips:

- [x] Read the event's home page carefully; many events have special rules to serve their community's needs
- [x] If you aren't sure you can make a game, don't sign up
- [x] If you need to drop at the last minute, email the organizer or post in the discussion tab
- [x] Do not drop games at the last minute often; strive to be known for reliability
- [x] Do not no-call-no-show
- [x] Always enter your class and level; if you aren't sure what to bring or play, post about it in the discussion tab
- [x] Double check event locations before signing up
- [x] If you cannot/will not play on a particular VTT, do not sign up for games that do not have a VTT listed
- [x] Do not use the discussion tag to start flame wars about what VTT you think is best
- [x] Don't be shy about waitlisting; if the organizer knows there's extra interest in a game, they can add more tables
