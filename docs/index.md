# A Curated Collection of Guides, Focused on Organized play

This collection of guides is sourced from various VOs in the community, because they need a good home. None of these guides are officially endorsed by Paizo or the OPF. The hope is that this can become a useful, open-source documentation hub can with many contributors.
