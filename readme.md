# Readme

This site is generated using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). You can run this site locally to preview any changes you want. 

Please refer to the yaml file in the project root to see plugins and markdown extensions used. Generally, I believe in adhering to vanilla Markdown but wanted to add features such as definition lists, admonitions, lazy loading, figure elements with captions for greater accessibility, etc.
