### PC Woof Character Sheet 
###### Author: BigNorseWolf

A Macro based starfinder character sheet that doesn't care what roll 20 table it's in. Simple sheet table? No problem. Official sheet table? Easy as pie. You can literally plop it into tales of equestria table and it still works just fine. This was made for DMs to very quickly make monsters, but expanded into a character sheet. If you already have a character made and want them on roll20 in 10 minutes this is a good option.

This also has a macros 202 class. How to make simple roll20 templates, add pictures, drop down menus, and how to duct tape stored numbers. It's roughly every tool I know how to use.
